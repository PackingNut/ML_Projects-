# ML_Projects
Repository containing machine learning projects completed for coursework and experimentation.
This repository is used to organize and maintain multiple machine learning projects created during my CSUSB Machine Learning classes.

## Project Structure

Each folder represents a separate Machine Learning project with its own experiments, scripts, and outputs using different algorithms studied in class.

## Topics Covered

Projects in this repository may include:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation
- Clustering techniques
- Classification workflows
- Python-based ML pipelines

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- etc.

## Dataset Notes

Large datasets and generated output files are excluded from version control using `.gitignore` due to github size restrictions and developer(me) safety.

If a dataset is required:

1. Download the dataset manually (example: Kaggle or class-provided sources)
2. Place it inside the corresponding project folder
3. Run the project scripts

## Purpose
This repository serves as:

* Coursework archive and showcase of coding abilities
* Machine learning experimentation environment
* Portfolio reference
